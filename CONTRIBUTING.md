# Contributing

Thank you for your intrest in contributing to this project.

## Pull Requests

All changes must be submitted via a pull request. If a Pull Request is submitted without an associated issue, please ensure that the information which would have been present in the issue is included within the description panel. Empty Pull Requests and pull requests with minimal, confusing or descriptions hard to understand may be closed without warning.

Before submitting your Pull Request, please ensure that: your code compiles, The linter passes without errors and the Unit Tests all pass. This can be achieved easily by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

When adding new functionality, you will most likely be asked to include said new functionality within Unit Tests. It is a good idea to ensure these are included before opening your Pull Request.
